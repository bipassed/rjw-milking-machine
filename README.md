## Requires RimJobWorld (obviously) and Vanilla Expanded Framework
**Tutorial**
To begin milking a colonist you'll want to create either a penis milking machine or a breast milking machine, both costing 45 units of any leathery material at a tailoring bench. The penis milking machine produces a variable amount of used condoms / cum if [Sexperience](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/193448-mod-rjw-sexperience-continued/) is active each day. The same is said for a breast milking machine, but instead of cum it's milk. 
Before you start your new milk farm, you should take note of the following:
 - Size matters
 - Sex need matters
 - Vaginas do not produce anything
 - The only breasts that modify milk output are the udders and archotech
 - The only penises that modify cum output are horse, dog, demon, dragon and archotech
 - Multiple breasts and multiple penises increase production

**Known Incompatibilities**
 - [Coffees RJW Ideology Addons](https://gitgud.io/c0ffeeeeeeee/coffees-rjw-ideology-addons) | Not inherently incompatible, they just don't integrate with each other.
 - [Rimworld-Animation Patch](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/23398-rimworld-animation-patch/) | This mod makes parts from RimNudeWorld not show up while wearing milking apparel.
