## Requires RimJobWorld (obviously) and Vanilla Expanded Framework
**Tutorial**
To begin milking a colonist you'll want to create either a penis milking machine or a breast milking machine, both costing 45 units of any leathery material at a tailoring bench. The penis milking machine produces a variable amount of used condoms / cum if [Sexperience](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/193448-mod-rjw-sexperience-continued/) is active each day. The same is said for a breast milking machine, but instead of cum it's milk. 
Before you start your new milk farm, you should take note of the following:
 - Size matters
 - Vaginas do not produce anything
 - The only breasts that modify milk output are the udders
 - The only penises that modify cum output are horse, dog, demon and dragon
 - Each piece of the apparel lowers consciousness and moving by 20%, while increasing hunger rate by 20%

**Known Incompatibilities**
 - None. If you know one make an issue about it
